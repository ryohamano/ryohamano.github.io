Hi ! I am a second year Masters student in [Mochizuki group](https://mochizuki.w.waseda.jp/), Department of Pure and Applied Physics, [Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering](https://www.ase.sci.waseda.ac.jp/english/departments/), [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I am conducting theoretical research in condensed matter physics, with a particular interest in photoinduced magnetic phenomena.
My focus includes:

- Linear and nonlinear responses under intense light irradiation
- Photoinduced magnetic phase transitions

I aim to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of light-matter interactions that drive magnetic ordering and phase transitions in quantum materials.

### Intrests
-----
- Photo-induced phase transitions
- Floquet engineering
- Nonequilibrium quantum dynamics simmulation
- Nonequilibrium response theory
